    "A financial index is a statistical indicator that reflects the change in value of a set of financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, or other financial instruments.\n",
    "It is used to:\n",
    "- Measure the performance of a given market or sector.\n",
    "- Serve as a benchmark for financial products (ETFs, index funds, etc.).\n",
    "- Compare returns between different asset classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of well-known financial indices: CAC 40 (France), Stoxx Europe 600 (Europe), S&P 500 (United States).\n",
    "\n",
    "An index is not a financial instrument in itself, since it cannot be traded (bought or sold). It does not represent a monetary value but rather a reference value. An investor wishing to gain exposure to the risk represented by a given index generally uses an ETF, which is designed to replicate the chosen financial index.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Index Composition**\n",
    "\n",
    "Selection criteria: The index groups companies according to factors such as:\n",
    "- Size (market capitalization)\n",
    "- Industry sector\n",
    "- Country or geographic area\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples: CAC 40: 40 large French companies listed on Euronext Paris, S&P 500: 500 large U.S. companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although thematic indices are the most common, other more complex indices exist. If an investment strategy can be defined based on a set of rules, it can be expressed in the form of an index.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weighting Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Market capitalization weighting: Each company has a weight proportional to its market capitalization.\n",
    "- Equal weighting: Each company has the same weight in the index at the time of rebalancing.\n",
    "- Risk-based weighting: Each company is weighted according to its volatility or another risk indicator.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Calculation of the Index Value**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the investment universe is defined and the weighting method chosen, the index value/performance is calculated at set intervals, generally on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Index Rebalancing** \n",
    "\n",
    "Index rebalancing is the process by which the composition or weighting of the securities that make up a stock index is periodically adjusted.\n",
    "This ensures that the index remains representative of the market or sector it measures. Rebalancing may include:\n",
    "- Adding new companies that meet the criteria.\n",
    "- Removing companies that no longer meet the requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Index rebalancing also helps manage weighting drift between rebalancing dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rebalancing frequency is defined before the index is launched; it can be monthly, quarterly, or yearly. Some market events can trigger exceptional rebalancing (e.g., a volatility spike for certain indices based on a quantitative strategy).\n"
